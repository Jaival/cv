\section*{Cover Letter}

\textbf{Dear Hiring Manager,}

I am excited to apply for the DevOps Engineer position at [Company]. With hands-on experience supporting AWS-based production systems for a \dotnet{} CMS product and current graduate studies in Computer Science at RPTU, I bring a pragmatic approach to reliability, automation, and collaborative delivery.

\textbf{What I can bring to your team:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Production-minded AWS support:} Monitored servers, performed upgrades/patching, and partnered with developers to resolve incidents and ship releases across multiple environments.
    \item \textbf{Faster, safer releases:} Streamlined deployment steps and authored runbooks/SOPs that reduced manual effort by 20\% and cut onboarding time by 30\%.
    \item \textbf{Clear communication:} Translated operational issues into clear action items, improving ticket turnaround times and cross-team alignment.
\end{itemize}

I took time away from full-time work to pursue my M.Sc., deepening my foundation in operating systems, networks, cloud computing, and machine learning. This period sharpened my ability to reason about performance, security, and scalabilityâ€”skills I am eager to apply to real-world systems at [Company].

I'm motivated by environments where uptime, feedback loops, and continuous improvement matter. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background in AWS support, release coordination, and systematic problem-solving can help [Company] enhance reliability and ship faster with confidence.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to speaking with you.

\textbf{Sincerely,} \\
Jaival Saija
